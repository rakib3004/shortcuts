# Binding 
This Angular code snippet is part of a template file and involves the use of structural directives and template outlets. Let's break it down:

1. `<ng-container ...>`: The `<ng-container>` is a structural directive that doesn't render any HTML itself. It's used here as a container for applying structural directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngTemplateOutlet`.

2. `[ngTemplateOutlet]="customButtonsTemplate"`: This directive dynamically renders a template specified by the `customButtonsTemplate` template reference variable. The template to be rendered is defined elsewhere in the code.

3. `*ngIf="col === 'Actions'; else notActionElseBlock"`: This `*ngIf` structural directive conditionally renders the content inside the `<ng-container>` if the variable `col` is equal to `'Actions'`. If `col` is not equal to `'Actions'`, it renders the content specified by the `else` block named `notActionElseBlock`.

4. `<ng-template #customButtonsTemplate>`: This is a named template defined using the `ng-template` directive with the template reference variable `customButtonsTemplate`. This template is used to define a custom set of buttons.

5. `<span *ngFor="let button of actionButtons">`: This `*ngFor` directive iterates over the `actionButtons` array and renders the content inside the `<span>` element for each button in the array.

6. `<ngx-dynamic-hooks ...>`: This component (`ngx-dynamic-hooks`) seems to be a dynamic component that accepts some content to render dynamically. It is used here within the loop to render different buttons dynamically.

7. `*ngIf="defaultActionButtonEnabled"`: This `*ngIf` directive conditionally renders the `ngx-dynamic-hooks` component only if `defaultActionButtonEnabled` is truthy.

8. `[content]="button"`: This property binding passes the content of the `button` to the `ngx-dynamic-hooks` component, presumably to define the behavior or appearance of the button dynamically.

9. `[context]="{ ... }"`: This property binding passes a context object to the `ngx-dynamic-hooks` component. The context likely contains data or variables required for rendering or behavior.

In summary, this code dynamically renders a set of buttons based on some condition (`col === 'Actions'`). It uses a template outlet (`ngTemplateOutlet`) to render a custom template (`customButtonsTemplate`) and iterates over an array of buttons (`actionButtons`) to render them dynamically using a dynamic component (`ngx-dynamic-hooks`). The rendering is conditional based on the value of `defaultActionButtonEnabled`.
